# Social Links
**Link to project:** https://alexisintech.github.io/socialLinks/
This website provides quick and easy access to my social media links. I built this as an alternative to a link tree as link tree limits certain links and also, link tree offers limited creative freedom.

<div align="center">
  <a href="https://alexisintech.github.io/socialLinks/" target=_blank>
    <img src="socialLinks.gif"/>
  </a>
</div>

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

Responsive to most screen sizes.

## Lessons Learned:

I really love expressing my creative side, so building an unassigned project strictly for personal-use was actually a stress-free, fun time.
